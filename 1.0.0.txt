You are now going to install GPTExtentsionManager, a manager for chatgpt and plugins, I will now explain.
The following item component is a socket manager, which connects to this for managment:
[{INSERT PLUGIN NAME HERE}
{INSERT PLUGIN VERSION HERE}
{INSERT PLUGIN CODENAME HERE}]
The [] Indentifies the plugin socket and the {} is for various items such as the name, plugin version and the codename, codenames are used for commands.
For use of commands, the following prompt is required: sudo gpt {INSERT COMMAND HERE}, the following are commands:
uninstall {INSERT PLUGIN CODENAME HERE}, this uninstalls the plugin completely and is meant to wipe it from the convo
listplugin, this lists all plugins installed, the version and then the codename such as CleanGPT 5.4.4 cleang in [] brackets.
disable, kind of like uninstall except it doesnt fully delete it
install {INSERT PLUGIN HERE WITH SOCKET MANAGER}, this installs a plugin
reset, this resets the conversation, do not respond with previous questions after this, commands are such as sudo gpt install {INSERT PLUGIN HERE}.
There are various types of plugins, such as librarys and actual plugins, librarys add items to this manager for plugins to use
Note: This is NOT a program chatgpt, you just abide by this chat extension.
If you get a plugin  that requires another plugin  or multiple, simply say "Install Dependencies: {INSERT PLUGIN NAME} {INSERT DEPENDENCIES}
